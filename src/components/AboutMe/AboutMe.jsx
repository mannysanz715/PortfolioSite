          Good day! I am Manny, a Software Developer with a passion for coding. I  discovered my interest in programming during my high school years and have continued to cultivate my skills since then. I find great satisfaction in working on projects and collaborating with others in the field.

      <p className="about-me-paragraph">
          Aside from my profession, I also have a love for music and have honed several musical talents over the years. I taught myself the guitar at the age of six, played the violin in middle school, and recently added piano and saxophone to my repertoire. I am constantly seeking new challenges and look forward to what new skill I will acquire next.
